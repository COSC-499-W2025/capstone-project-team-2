## How Your Data Will Be Used

Your data will be:

- Loaded and processed **locally** on your machine  
- Used to perform analysis and generate results  
- Stored only on your system unless you manually export or share it  

You may exit now if you do not wish to continue.

> **You must consent to local data use to run the program.**

## Optional External Processing

The program can optionally send portions of your data to trusted external AI services
(e.g., large language model APIs) to enhance analysis quality.

If you choose **NO** for external processing:

- Your data **stays local**
- The system still runs with **basic analysis only**

---

## What We Do NOT Do

We do **not**:

- Collect personal information outside the data you provide
- Sell or share your data
- Store your data remotely

## Revoking Consent

You can revoke consent at any time.  
When revoked:

- Local processing stops
- External processing (if enabled) stops
- You may delete any local project files or outputs  

---

## Your Choice

At runtime you will be asked:

1. **Do you consent to local data processing?** (required)
2. **Do you consent to external processing?** (optional)

You may type:

- `yes` — proceed
- `no` — decline
- `view` — see this agreement again
- `exit` — quit the program

---

By typing **YES**, you acknowledge:

- You understand and agree to local processing
- External processing is optional and controlled by you
