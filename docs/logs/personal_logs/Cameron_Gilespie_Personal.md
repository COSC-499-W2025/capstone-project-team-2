## Associated Tasks from Project Board:

| Description        | Status   |

## Next week goals
The goals for Week 6:
- Discuss issues on Kanban board for next steps
- Identification of group/individual projects

---

### Extra Details:

<details>
The primary goal for me this week was the finalize the overall system of my directory scanner and then provide integration regarding the extraction of types of meta data contained with in the files. As of completion it can extract the author, creation/modification date, size, as well as the types of files it pulls. I ultimately want to give a big thank you to Samantha for her insight and assistance with my code review this week since unfortunately I made some rather large errors with it in the previous sprint that I have now fully corrected. This has been an huge learning experience for myself as a whole with python programming. My hope for next week is that I can tackle the identification of group/individual projects in the upcoming week and apply the learning I have gained this week to the project going forward.

## Next week goals
The goals for Week 6:
- Discuss issues on Kanban board for next steps
- Evolve the Heirarchy Scanner to extract basic data from files

---

### Extra Details:

<details>
My primary goal was to create essentially the skeleton for our file data extraction which first required a program able to pull in the files from a specific directory and then detect the file structure. The proof of this is in the output of all the file names in the correct directory structure. In the coming weeks I plan to further evolve this to collect data such as Modification Dates, Creation dates as well as anything else we might include in our project. I also this week provided some overview to Immanuel to discuss his coding segment as well as to ensure my own understanding of python was correct given this was my first time coding in python
