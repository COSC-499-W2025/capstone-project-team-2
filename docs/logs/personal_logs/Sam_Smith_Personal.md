### Extra Details:
This week we were a bit late assigning tasks due to class being cancelled on Monday and a quiz on Tuesday. It was also very busy for most of us because of midterms, so we tried to make the tasks relatively smaller than usual.

### Tasks for Next Sprint:
- Write the code for initiating user configurations on app startup
- Update tests to pull in real code for unit testing
