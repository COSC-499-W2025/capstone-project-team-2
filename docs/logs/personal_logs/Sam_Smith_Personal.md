### Extra Details:
This week went very rough for me in my personal life. In addition there were some issues with docker and mySQL not working together correctly and some missing code in the development branch due to a merging issue. As a result I wasn't able to test my code, so it remains unmerged with the development branch until we can get it sorted out.

### Tasks for Next Sprint:
- Finish integrating code into CLI
