### Weekly Goals Recap
We worked on outlining the project’s functional and non-functional requirements based on our current understanding. We created a draft and then got input from three other teams to see where we could make improvements.
With their feedback, we made some adjustments to ensure the requirements were more specific, measurable, and easier to follow.

### Weekly Goals Recap
This week, I focused on contributing to the project proposal by developing detailed use cases and creating the UML use case diagram. We collaborated as a team on this and outlining the system architecture, incorporating feedback from our initial drafts to ensure they aligned with the project's overall objectives.

### Additional Details
- **Project Proposal Tasks**: Completed use cases, UML diagram and system architecture outline.
- **Team Meetings**: Participated in discussions to align on proposal structure.
- **Individual Contributions**: Researched best practices for UML diagrams and system architecture.

### Plan for the Next Cycle
In the upcoming week (09/29/2025 – 10/05/2025), I will collaborate with the team on creating the data flow diagram at level 1. Additionally, we will work on finalizing the system design, allocating work tasks and reading up on agile development practices.

### Reflection Points
#### What Went Well
Our team collaborated effectively, with strong communication through regular Discord check-ins and clearly defined responsibilities that kept everyone accountable. We also made efficient use of shared documents for real-time edits, which streamlined our workflow and helped us meet deadlines without last-minute rushes.

#### What Didn't Go Well
We encountered no significant issues this week, though minor delays in gathering reference materials slightly extended our research phase.

This week was effective, with solid progress on the project proposal and clear use cases supported by UML diagrams. Suggestions from other teams and the professor helped us spot and fix design gaps. Our team's strong rapport led to smooth conversations and prompt updates, keeping the group in sync.
