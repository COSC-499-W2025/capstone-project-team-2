### Weekly Goals Recap
We worked on outlining the project’s functional and non-functional requirements based on our current understanding. We created a draft and then got input from three other teams to see where we could make improvements.
With their feedback, we made some adjustments to ensure the requirements were more specific, measurable, and easier to follow.
