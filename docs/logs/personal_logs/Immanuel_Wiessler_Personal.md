## 🚀 Features Worked On  
-  Collaborated with teammates on the **DFD Graph** (Level 0 and Level 1)  
-  Completed the **team log** for Week 5

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals  
- Review finalized **project requirements** 
- Finalize **system design** for new project requirements
- Create a  new **DFD Desgin** for these new project requirements  
- Revise Docker

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Current Cycle (Week 5)  
This week we demonstrated effective teamwork in the development of the **DFD design** based on our project requirements which we submitted in week 4 making sure to include the necessary requiremnets for both **level 0** and **level 1**, which included the external actors and the way in which the data flowed from our backend to the frontend **(UI)** and at the same time, One thing I noticed is that now we have finally settle into assumed roles. To conclude this weeks reflection one thing I noticed is that we had one small issue in terms of communication task this week which was that one of the team members created both level 0 and level 1 without informing the other teams members that they had finished the graphs, Moving forward we are going to introucde a system in dicord server to ensure that everyone knows who is currently working on what task, to prevent duplicate task or code.

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Past Cycle (Week 4)  
Looking back at **Week 4**, our team developed a better understanding of each member’s working style, which helped us stay more consistent with the assignment of tasks. This improved coordination allowed us to finalize our **project requirements** in a timely manner. In my view, Week 4 marked a turning point where the team really began to **“click”**, laying the groundwork for smoother collaboration in the following weeks for this project

---

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals  
- Beginning work on the newly created issues in our kanban project/ continue working on current issue assigned to me

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Current Cycle (Week 6)
This week, we began updating both our **DFD graph** and our **System Architecture Design** to incorporate the newly introduced project requirements for Milestone 1. We began populating our GitHub Kanban board with the associated issues in Milestone 1. Additionally, this week marks the actual start of the project, because we began coding some of the problems. For example, in my case, I worked on the initial development of the **file extraction system**, where I focused on extracting components (taking a zip file and extracting its contents). At the same time, I worked on creating the **pytest file** to test the functionality of my extraction file. In addition, I made the **requirements.txt** file consisting of the possible Python libraries that we can use in our project, where we discuss these libraries and
Additionally, considering that my overall team's Python skill level is minimal, I need to ensure that the chosen libraries are easy to pick up.


Overall, this week we did not encounter any significant issues with each other, and we also introduced the proposed system to help prevent miscommunication, specifically duplicate code and tasks.


---

## 🧠 Reflection on Past Cycle (Week 5)
For week 5, I began to notice that our team structure has become more organized, unlike last week, which was unorganized, but overall week 5 has nothing to report in terms of team structure and general stuff

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals  
- To contiune working on the [storing user configuration ](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-2/issues/36) intergating the actual coding part of this issue 

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Current Cycle (Week 7)
For week 7, I began working on the storing of user's configuration more specfically created the tests for the user's storage where I work on creating the actual system in the following. From week 6 I was able to intergate my gained knolwedge on **pytest unittest framework** into this test called `test_userConfig_store.py`. Overall this week was a vaildation week because I am now after grafting/learning about pytest I was able to easily intergate my new found knowlege into the test case that I have created for this sprint



---

## 🧠 Reflection on Past Cycle (Week 6)  
For week 6, I was working on the issue that I assigned myself for that week, which was the extraction of a zip file and exporting its contents to a temporary directory for file mapping, while creating tests at the same time. This week was rough because this is my first time trying to create a test using Python **unittest framework** in Python, which I have not done before, which was a challenge but also interesting. In addition, it was our first time reviewing each other's code and having meaningful conversations about what we should add, and in my case, more edge cases. Overall, week 6 was interesting in terms of learning the **unittest python framework** and reviewing other team members' code and providing improvement/suggestions.
