## üß† Reflection on Current Cycle (Week 5)  
This week we demonstrated this week we demonstrated effective teamwork in the development of the **DFD design** based on our project requirements which we submitted in week 4 making sure to include the necessary requiremnets for both **level 0** and **level 1**, which included the external actors and the way in which the data flowed from our backend to the frontend **(UI)** and at the same time, One thing I noticed is that now we have finally settle into assumed roles. To conclude this weeks reflection one thing I noticed is that we had one small issue in terms of communication task this week which was that one of the team members created both level 0 and level 1 without informing the other teams members that they had finished the graphs, Moving forward we are going to introucde a system in dicord server to ensure that everyone knows who is currently working on what task, to prevent duplicate task or code.

---

## üß† Reflection on Past Cycle (Week 4)  
Looking back at **Week 4**, our team developed a better understanding of each member‚Äôs working style, which helped us stay more consistent with the assignment of tasks. This improved coordination allowed us to finalize our **project requirements** in a timely manner. In my view, Week 4 marked a turning point where the team really began to **‚Äúclick‚Äù**, laying the groundwork for smoother collaboration in the following weeks for this project
