## 🚀 Features Worked On  
-  Collaborated with teammates on the **DFD Graph** (Level 0 and Level 1)  
-  Completed the **team log** for Week 5

## 📌 Associated Tasks from Project Board  
- N/A (Project board not yet populated)

| **Team Log – Week 5** | ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green) |

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals  
- Review finalized **project requirements** 
- Finalize **system design** for new project requirements
- Create a  new **DFD Desgin** for these new project requirements  
- Revise Docker

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Current Cycle (Week 5)  
This week we demonstrated effective teamwork in the development of the **DFD design** based on our project requirements which we submitted in week 4 making sure to include the necessary requiremnets for both **level 0** and **level 1**, which included the external actors and the way in which the data flowed from our backend to the frontend **(UI)** and at the same time, One thing I noticed is that now we have finally settle into assumed roles. To conclude this weeks reflection one thing I noticed is that we had one small issue in terms of communication task this week which was that one of the team members created both level 0 and level 1 without informing the other teams members that they had finished the graphs, Moving forward we are going to introucde a system in dicord server to ensure that everyone knows who is currently working on what task, to prevent duplicate task or code.

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Past Cycle (Week 4)  
Looking back at **Week 4**, our team developed a better understanding of each member’s working style, which helped us stay more consistent with the assignment of tasks. This improved coordination allowed us to finalize our **project requirements** in a timely manner. In my view, Week 4 marked a turning point where the team really began to **“click”**, laying the groundwork for smoother collaboration in the following weeks for this project

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals  
- Begining working coding in regards to new issues on our kanaban project 

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Current Cycle (Week 5)
This week, we began updating both our **DFD graph** and our **System Architecture Design** to incorporate the newly introduced project requirements for Milestone 1. We began populating our GitHub Kanban board with the associated issues in milestone Additionally, this week marks the actual start of the project, because we began coding some of the problems. For example, in my case, I worked on the beginning of the **file extraction system** and also created the **requirements.txt** file consisting of the possible Python libraries that we can use  in our project, where we discuss these libraries and
Also, taking into account that my overall team's Python skill level is minimal, ensuring that the chosen libraries are easy to pick up


Overall, this week we did not encounter any significant issues with each other, and we also introduced the proposed system to help prevent miscommunication, specifically duplicate code and tasks.

## 🧠 Reflection on Past Cycle (Week 5)  
For week 5 I began to notice that our team structure has become more organized unlike last week which was orgainzied, but overall week 5 has nothing to report in terms of team structure and general sstuff
