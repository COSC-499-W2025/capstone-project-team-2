## Next week goals
I will discuss with the team about the tasks that I can take up this week and how I can contribute on Monday.

### Extra Details:
<details>
    <summary><span style='font-weight:bold'>Click to expand</span> </summary>
  I worked on creating a CLI-based system to get user consent for using and accessing their data and also for using external services. The system handles all different possibilities or scenarios and presents users with clear and concise data privacy implications. The system handles invalid inputs as well. I have also added tests for both the requirements to make sure the code doesn't break in any situation.
