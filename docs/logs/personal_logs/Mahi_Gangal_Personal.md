### Extra Details:
<details>
    <summary><span style='font-weight:bold'>Click to expand</span> </summary>
  I focused on completing the core functionality for distinguishing between individual and collaborative projects across both GitHub-based and non-GitHub-based submissions. For GitHub repositories, I implemented logic to analyze commit histories and author metadata to accurately determine whether a project involved multiple contributors. For non-GitHub submissions, I extended similar logic using project metadata to classify the project type, even when repository data was unavailable. I also developed and executed comprehensive unit tests to validate both implementations and ensure that the detection logic handled various edge cases—such as missing metadata, single-author repos, and projects with multiple contributors. During integration, I encountered and resolved merge conflicts while reverting and merging commits in the project_type_detection branch. I resolved these issues successfully using git revert, manual conflict resolution, and cleanup of modified files to maintain a stable and consistent codebase. Overall, this week’s work finalized the project type detection feature and ensured its reliability through testing, integration, and conflict resolution.

### Features Worked on this Milestone   
  * Fixed code and test failures caused by recent refactoring in related modules.

## Next week goals

### Extra Details:
<details>
    <summary><span style='font-weight:bold'>Click to expand</span> </summary>
  This week, I focused on debugging and stabilizing the project type detection and contribution analysis modules after a teammate’s code refactor introduced integration issues. With Puneet’s help, a key bug caused by inconsistent path handling between different operating systems was resolved. I then worked on implementing the new feature for extrapolating individual contributions from non-Git collaborative projects, allowing the system to attribute work to contributors using file metadata, contributor files, and name-based heuristics. I also created robust unit tests to validate this logic under various edge cases, ensuring that both the feature and tests are platform-agnostic and maintainable. Overall, this week’s work focused on stabilization, refinement, and extending our contribution analysis capabilities. Next week, I plan to extend contribution extrapolation logic to Git-based collaborative projects after doing the required research.

### Extra Details:
<details>
    <summary><span style='font-weight:bold'>Click to expand</span> </summary>
  This week, I finalized and tested the logic for extrapolating individual contributions from Git-based collaborative projects. Building on the non-Git logic from last week, this new implementation analyzes Git commit histories to identify and attribute files to contributors, merging multiple identities through canonical name detection. I also handled complex edge cases such as different author emails, missing contributor files, and untracked files. To improve robustness, I added the `_collapse_buckets` function to merge duplicate contributor entries and maintain clean outputs. I wrote and executed several unit tests to verify Git attribution under diverse conditions — including subdirectory commits, variant author names, and canonical merging via CONTRIBUTORS files. Minor fixes also had to be made to handle POSIX-relative paths across macOS and Windows, ensuring consistency. Overall, this week marked the completion of Git contribution detection and its integration into the unified contribution analysis system. Next week, I plan to collaborate with the team on integration and validation of the system, for Milestone 1.

### Features Worked on this Milestone   
#### Week 12
  * Implemented the DELETE functionality so that users can delete previous generated insights, ensuring files that are shared across multiple reports do not get affected. Added tests to make sure everything is working as expected.
  * Unified deletion workflow that handles menu selection, confirmation prompts, database record scanning and safe filesystem cleanup.
  * Worked on integrating the various components of our system and debugging in the process.
      - Added the mandatory privacy consent (external-service (LLM) and local-data-analysis) before the system can run.
      - Added explicit error handling for robust ZIP extraction validation.
      - Added clear listing of previously saved analyses.
      - Fixed issues related to duration of the project.
#### Week 11 (Bonus Week)
  * Implemented association of individual contributions in collaborative projects with skills, adding caching for performance.
  * Added 11 comprehensive test cases to cover all edge cases.

### Extra Details:
<details>
    <summary><span style='font-weight:bold'>Click to expand</span> </summary>
This week I focused heavily on core system reliability, especially around delete operations and user-facing workflow consistency. The biggest accomplishment was building the delete functionality, handling dual deletion paths (filesystem + database), matching DB rows to filenames, and implementing safe-delete reference counting. I also added the implemented full consent workflow, now required before the CLI even reaches the main menu. This added crucial privacy compliance as per the requirements. ZIP extraction was rewritten to have explicit validation with actionable error messages, replacing silent or vague failures. To unify user experience, the “Saved Projects” and “Delete Analysis” menus were redesigned to rely solely on the filesystem. This change ensures consistent behavior whether DB or disk is out of sync.
These changes required updating a some portions of the test suite. I wrote new tests and updated older ones to reflect the new architecture. Overall, this week significantly strengthened the system’s robustness, safety, and user trust and closed multiple previously open system-level integration gaps.

### Features Worked on this Milestone   
#### Week 12
  * Completed support for contribution-percentages in non-Git projects using file counts.
  * Deep Analysis Module for Python Projects
      - Built a full analysis engine for Python projects.
      - Extracts OOP structure (classes, inheritance, overrides, private attributes, dunders).
      - Adds data-structure usage analysis and algorithm/complexity signals.
      - Generates narrative explanations that interpret developer skill and design decisions.
      - Computes overall OOP score with qualitative feedback.
  * Added comprehensive tests for both features.
  * Integrated the analyzer into the main workflow so insights, metrics, and narratives appear in final reports.

### Extra Details:
<details>
    <summary><span style='font-weight:bold'>Click to expand</span> </summary>
This sprint I focused on strengthening the analytical depth and reliability of our system. The biggest chunk of work was building the complete Python static-analysis module from scratch, something far beyond basic metrics. The analyzer now interprets classes, inheritance patterns, private attributes, overridden methods, and dunder usage, and pairs this with data-structure patterns and algorithmic/complexity signals. The goal was not just to count things, but to translate them into meaningful insights that reflect a developer’s design decisions and technical ability. I also wrote an extensive set of tests to validate the analyzer’s behavior across edge cases, including syntax errors, empty directories, nested classes, and attribute-detection scenarios. Integrating this module into the main workflow required refactoring parts of the system so results are saved, loaded, and deleted consistently. Alongside this, I completed the PR enabling contribution analysis for non-Git collaborative projects, ensuring consistent behavior across all project types. Overall, this sprint was about raising the intelligence, stability, and polish of the system so it’s ready for the Milestone #1 demo.
