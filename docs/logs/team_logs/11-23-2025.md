## Overview:
This week the team focused heavily on core system stability, integration, and feature completeness as we approach Milestone 1. Major progress was made across all layers of the system: deleting analyses safely, integrating the CLI/UI workflows, loading project JSON data reliably, improving Docker automation for testing, and introducing AI powered analysis support.

Mahi delivered substantial integration updates and the full delete workflow, Samantha ensured accurate project loading and metadata restoration, Cameron improved the Docker based testing pipeline, Immanuel added automatic Docker configuration and integrated AI analysis, and Puneet expanded the insights and ranking engine with skill history and summary generation. Sam contributed to the overall system integration and CLI improvements, working on wiring together multiple workflows to ensure the system behaves consistently across all entry points

The **next cycle** will focus on:  
- Final integration of all remaining components  
- Docker auto-launch quality improvements  
- AI JSON formatting enhancements  
- Strengthening connections between JSON storage and CLI  
- Final polishing before Milestone 1 demo
