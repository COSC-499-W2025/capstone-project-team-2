## Overview:
This sprint marked significant functional growth in the analysis and configuration modules. Mahi successfully implemented the logic to distinguish between individual and collaborative projects for both GitHub and non-repository sources, supported by comprehensive unit testing. Immanuel introduced a refined CLI interface for saving and updating user configurations, simplifying the configuration workflow. Cameron enhanced file hierarchy parsing and ensured author metadata was extracted consistently across platforms, while continuing Docker environment research.
Puneet extended the stack and skill detection module to include Infrastructure and DevOps categories, broadening insight coverage. Sam completed the integration of the startup configuration loader with the CLI interface, ensuring user preferences are loaded automatically at runtime. Samantha built a unified data extraction orchestrator that runs all extraction protocols in sequence, improving modularity and error reporting.

Next sprint will focus on collaboration analytics and performance optimization — specifically, tracking contribution ratios within collaborative repositories, refining the unified extraction flow, and expanding cross-platform metadata handling.
