## Overview:
This week marks the transitionary period as we move to focus on making a working demo as well as developing our data analysis mechanisms. Focus was put on finishing modules that are neccessary to the initial work for the demo as well as setting up systems that are essential to the demo's devlopment. Sam, Immanuel and Cameron were given these tasks and enough progress has been made that an incomplete demo could be made in the next few cycles. A secondary focus for remaining team members with the ideas to set up data analysis structures was placed so development of the data analysis module could gain momentum. Samantha, Puneet and Mahi have been working on this and the frameworks for further development are established.

The **next cycle** will focus on:  
- Demo prototyping with our in place modules will begin.
- Further devlopment of data analysis structures, and hopefully communication between systems this or next cycle.
