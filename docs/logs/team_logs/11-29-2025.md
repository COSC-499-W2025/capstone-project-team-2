## Overview:

This week marks the final stretch for Milestone 1, where we began finalizing our CLI demo for viewing and interaction. Focus this week was to create a proper resume and proftiolo and dicatated by the prof which was handle by Immanuel through the use of the Google LLM(gemmi) to recived key information about the project itself, which include project summary, tech stack that is used, skills execrised and so on, Mahi worked on intergrating the contributors amount to the project to return the amount of work done by each person and also doing deeper anylsis on code files to retrive key information about abstriaction, encapsulation and so on when the user does not want to use external services, Samantha worked on taking the data from the Local llm, into a export json file, Sam anc Cameron began working on taking the finalized developed parts into a workable demo, additoanlly Cameron worked on the taking the data retrieved from the `AI_genertated resume` and formatting into a clean looking protfoilio and also creating/implementing our system **Ollama docker container**,Sam worked on intergating contributions for git and non-git project and Punnet worked on his system to improve the local analysis system and addtionally making sure that we had met the M1 deliverables. 




The **next cycle** will focus on:  
- Creating the video Demo
- Creating the team contract
- Fix up any underlaying issues that are still present 
- Preaping for final M1 submission
