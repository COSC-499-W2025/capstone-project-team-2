## Overview:

This week marks the final stretch for Milestone 1, where we began finalizing our CLI demo for viewing and interaction.Focus was on creating a proper resume and portfolio, as dictated by the professor.Immanuel handled this through the Google LLM (Gemma) to receive key project information, including project summary, tech stack, skills exercised, and more.
Mahi worked on integrating contributors’ data to return the amount of work done by each person, and performed deeper analysis on code files to retrieve key information about abstraction, encapsulation, and other metrics when the user does not want to use external services.Samantha worked on exporting data from the local LLM into a JSON file.Sam and Cameron began integrating the finalized parts into a workable demo.Additionally, Cameron formatted the AI-generated resume data into a clean portfolio and created/implemented the Ollama Docker container.am worked on integrating contributions for both git and non-git projects.Puneet restructured the CLI, separating database, menu, and analysis/persistence layers, added clear documentation, wrote tests, and ensured the database initializes only after user consent..




The **next cycle** will focus on:  
- Creating the video Demo
- Creating the team contract
- Fix up any underlaying issues that are still present 
- Preaping for final M1 submission
