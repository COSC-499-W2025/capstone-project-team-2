## Overview:
This week marked the beginning of the coding phase, as we transitioned from the documentation, planning, and design stages into implementation, where the team began to set up their development environments and begin working on their assigned inital tasks, Some of inital coding tasks that were completed for 
this week include **zip extraction**, **zip verification**, and **displaying the file structure of the uploaded zip file**.  In addition this week help us identify people's technincally know-how in respect to coding(**python**)

The **next cycle** will focus on:  
- Developing the future core requirements outlined in Milestone 1 requirement list and assigning to each of the team members for the following week
