''' if you are to run a test for this code run: 

docker-compose up db 

in your terminal, output should look something like the following

once we create the data base and wish to set up actual credentials

update the python code as well as lines 28-33 and run:

docker-compose down -v  # -v removes old data
docker-compose up db
